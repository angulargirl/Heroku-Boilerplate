## The Heroku Boilerplate

    The Heroku Boilerplate includes all the files you need to get NodeJS set up on Heroku.
    Note that this is not a boilerplate for Express apps. The idea is to get this running
    in an ide locally.

    The files were created from the Heroku tutorial, "Getting Started with Node.js and Heroku
    Heroku/Cedar" http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js

    Servers are programs or scripts that receive requests from clients via open ports / sockets
    respond with data and services.

## TCP and HTTP Protocols

    TCP, transmission control protocol is a protocol developed for the internet to get data from one
    network device to another. The most basic server is a TCP server.

    One computer will run a program or script to act as the server to open its ports to other
    computers that will connect as clients. The main server script can accept 1 or more clients
    depending on how the program is setup.

    The connection between the TCP server and client(s) is persistent, once a connection is made it
    remains until one side disconnects.

    HTTP is built upon the TCP protocol. HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the connection method
    for the Web. A Web server (a program) will open a port and accept incoming connections. Web clients
    connect to server and make a request for web pages, images, CSS, JavaScript. Clients can be browsers,
    mobile apps and even other servers all making requests.

    When a request is received, the HTTP web server will respond appropriately with the data and some
    other meta information like status code; 200 - successful, 404 - not found, 500 - server error. After
    the web server responds the connection between the server and client is closed. For every request a
    connection is made and closed. Being an HTTP web server is a tiring job.

## Intro to NodeJS: a way to build your own server

    NodeJS (or Node) is a JavaScript framework to build HTTP web and TCP socket servers. These servers
    are run on code written in JavaScript using various node module libraries. Similar to Processing when
    you might include a library to perform a special function, Node's modules are organized by function.



## Run locally
    To run in Webstorm:
    run web.js
